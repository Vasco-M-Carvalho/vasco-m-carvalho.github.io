<h2 id="welcome">macronets: production networks in macroeconomics</h2>
<p>
I have been awarded an ERC starting grant worth almost 1 million Euros to undertake research into the role of production networks in macroeconomics.  Informal networks have always existed and have always been influential in shaping human behaviour, creating norms within society and communicating such ideas to a wider audience. However, in recent years, technology has played a stronger role in these social networks and enabled further research into this area.

It is an exciting time to be studying social networks as new data, plus advances in the internet, allow us to map and understand how social networks are created, evolved and, ultimately, affect social and economic interaction. My project will focus on explaining how informal organisations, such as social networks, interact with formal institutions, like markets or internal organisations. At the base of any market economy is trust and social networks are fundamental to building this trust. One part of my project will use network models to understand the interplay between markets and social networks. My research will provide an insight into how to organise and regulate markets when trading networks are established. Another part of the project will focus on how to design effective communication networks within organisations in order to optimise co-ordination of different tasks within a company in a changeable environment. The project will also look at the difficulties in communication caused by conflicting interests within an organisation.
The grant will enable me to run high profile conferences and seminars at our Colchester Campus, inviting prestigious international speakers and establishing new research collaborations with the University.
